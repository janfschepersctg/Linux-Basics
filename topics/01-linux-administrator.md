# The Linux system engineer
# Introduction

Linux administrators are back-end IT specialists who install, configure, and maintain Linux operating systems in a variety of organizations. This role involves server-side operations and troubleshooting tasks that support business-critical and development activities. Linux administrators also configure user access and monitor system stability and security through deployment and everyday use.

This role requires extensive familiarity with Linux systems and servers and may involve a high level of risk assessment and user support. Because Linux is an open-source operating system, administrators also frequently communicate and collaborate with other developers to develop and implement system enhancements.

## Linux Administrator Duties and Responsibilities


### Employment

While the specific duties of a Linux administrator can vary based on their business and industry, the general responsibilities of this role are relatively consistent. Based on listings that we analyzed, these duties include:

#### Install and Configure Linux Systems

A Linux administrator’s main responsibility is to install and set up Linux systems and servers, often for organization-wide deployment. They develop servers and work with individual users to ensure that the system works reliably and quickly and answer questions related to setup and installation. In this role, Linux administrators also set up the architecture of the system, including back-end databases and scripts for specific applications and use cases.

#### Perform System Maintenance

Linux administrators also perform routine system maintenance and resolve server-side issues as they arise. This aspect of the role requires the Linux administrator to review error logs and reported errors and seek out solutions. Frequently, Linux administrators need to work directly with the system’s source code to make necessary changes to ensure reliable performance and then deploy those changes throughout the system.

#### Create System Backups

Linux administrators also conduct system backups according to company or industry standards. They may perform these backups weekly, daily, or more frequently depending on system space and business needs. This improves system recovery after a crash or other outage and supports data integrity by ensuring that there is never a massive loss of vital information.

#### Monitor System Performance

In addition to maintaining Linux systems and servers, Linux administrators also monitor system performance to prevent slowdowns and crashes. They may examine daily traffic logs and reports or receive direct reports from end users. If the Linux administrator notices potential issues or recurring problems within the system, they develop and deploy solutions so that the system remains usable for all personnel.

#### Provide Technical Support and Guidance

Linux administrators provide technical support and guidance to users and other administrators. In many cases, the Linux administrator works closely with other developers to answer technical questions or resolve issues with server-side performance. They may also support users by assisting with installation and maintenance of Linux-based programs and help debug these applications so that they work with existing servers.

#### Maintain System Security

Finally, Linux administrators maintain system security by actively identifying faults and vulnerable areas within the system’s architecture. This part of the job requires extensive knowledge of viruses and other sources of system vulnerability, and requires the Linux administrator to proactively develop protections, particularly when deploying system-wide changes that can open up new vulnerabilities.
