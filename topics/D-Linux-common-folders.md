# Linux Directory Structure and File System Hierarchy
## Common Top Level Directories
Here are the most common top level directories that you need to be aware of and may interact with as a user of a Linux system.

`/` : The directory called “root.” It is the starting point for the file system hierarchy. Note that this is not related to the root, or superuser, account.

`/bin` : Binaries and other executable programs.

`/etc` : System configuration files.

`/home` : Home directories.

`/opt` : Optional or third party software.

`/tmp` : Temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.

`/usr` :User related programs.

`/var` : Variable data, most notably log files.

The Linux directory structure is like a tree. The base of the Linux file system hierarchy begins at the root. Directories branch off the root, but everything starts at root.
