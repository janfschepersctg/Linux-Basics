# CTG Devops Academy: linux

The working repository for the linux track.

## Installation

On your working machine, make sure you have installed recent versions of:

- [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and for Windows hosts also Git Bash. If you install Git with default settings (i.e. always click "Next" in the installer), you should be fine.
- Ansible (only on Mac/Linux)

## Getting started

- creating our virtual environment: `vagrant up`
- deleting our virtual environment: `vagrant destroy -f`
- SSH to our virtual environment: `vagrant ssh srv01`

## Contributors

- [Bert Van Vreckem](https://github.com/bertvv/): Maintainer of the vagrant skeleton on which this project is based.
